1.0

* Preliminary Python 3 support. All tests now pass under Python 3.2 on
  Windows.
* Extension modules on Mac and Windows replaced by pure-Python ctypes
  implementations. Thanks to Jérôme Laheurte.
* WinVaultKeyring now supports multiple passwords for the same service. Fixes
  #47.
* Most of the tests don't require user interaction anymore.
* Entries stored in Gnome Keyring appears now with a meaningful name if you try
  to browser your keyring (for ex. with Seahorse)
* Tests from Gnome Keyring no longer pollute the user own keyring.
* `keyring.util.escape` now accepts only unicode strings. Don't try to encode
  strings passed to it.

Backward-incompatibility
++++++++++++++++++++++++

The keyring file backends now always expect strings (not bytes) for service
and username parameters. Additionally, all parameters are encoded (for
ini-file compatibility) with a new encoding scheme that accepts high byte
characters. What this means for users is that one should not encode service
name or username when calling
get_password and set_password. Any keyrings storing passwords in file-backed
stores will fail to lookup those passwords using the old encoding.

To manually update a keyring file to support the new escaping, replace all
instances of _XX (where XX is a hex byte) with __xXX__ in service names and
user names.
